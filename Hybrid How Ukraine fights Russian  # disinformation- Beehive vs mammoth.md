This Hybrid CoE Research Report, a joint effort with the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), focuses on Ukrainian best practices in counter- ing disinformation, mainly in the period follow- ing Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion (FSI) of Ukraine. However, many of these prac- tices are the result of an evolution spanning the decade since the Euromaidan revolution. The report identifies the following ten lessons that the West could learn from the unique Ukrainian experience.
## Lesson 1: Laying a solid foundation is fundamental
A monitoring system so extensive that it generates overlap is a must. Rapidly refuting the lies, debunking disinformation, and setting the record straight are necessary conditions for successfully countering the disinformation campaigns. Action of any kind should be prioritized, contemplation must not paralyze efforts to fight back, and trial and error is both permitted and encouraged. 
## Lesson 2: Numbers are crucial
Numbers really matter, be they human resources, financial resources, the number of different countermeasures and the various actors implementing them, or the repetition of key narratives from as many speakers as possi- ble. Despite the fact that Ukrainians are putting far greater resources into counter-disinformation efforts than most Western countries, they understand that the aggressor still outstrips them. 

## Lesson 3: Overlap is not a drawback,but rigidity is
The overlap between various monitoring, debunking, and counter-disinformation efforts is encouraged, not avoided. More actors working on the same topic means more reliable output, faster responses, and safeguards against the failure of one of them. In coordination, the loose nature and lack of formal procedures facilitates and speeds up responses. 

## Lesson 4: Cherish the role of civil society
No government in the world can tackle the problem of disinformation alone. Civil society is absolutely crucial. Ukraine has shown how a vibrant, active and energetic civil society, con- stantly coming up with new ideas, protected the information space even before the government entered the scene, and how crucial it still is for many target audiences. 

## Lesson 5: Preparation is essential, but not a panacea
Preparation for the conflict was vital; it is important not only to prepare contingency plans and ensure that the relevant teams are ready to act in the event of war, but also to prepare the crisis messaging and backup chan- nels. However, plans must not become dogma; adaptability is also key. The Ukrainian example also serves as a warning, showing that despite facing a prolonged conflict, a society may still refuse to believe the worst-case scenarios.

## Executive summary


## Lesson 6: Punitive measures are a must
It is impossible to rely only on defence and building up resilience against attacks. Punitive measures that limit the capability of hostile actors, or at least impose additional costs on their behaviour, must be part of the package. For many Ukrainian practitioners, these tools are the most important when it comes to protect- ing the information space against the aggressor.

## Lesson 7: Humour is a serious matter
Content generating amusement is used very deliberately by Ukrainians. Humour helps to reach larger audiences, and humorous content goes viral more often. It also helps to boost the morale of those under attack, and increase resilience to aggression in both the kinetic and the information space. And finally, it helps to impose costs on the disinformers by mocking and ridiculing them, and damaging their credibility.

## Lesson 8: Actions speak louder than words
When the atrocities reached their most horri- fying level, it became impossible to use disin- formation narratives to convince people about a “brotherly” Russia that attacks exclusively military targets. When Western countries took in Ukrainian refugees and started sending mil- itary and financial aid, it became impossible to successfully claim that the West had abandoned Ukraine altogether. However, audiences in occu- pied territories, cut off from any sources of real information, are still under threat. 

## Lesson 9: The information war is not over – and won’t end anytime soon
Despite some optimistic takes by Western commentators, no one in Ukraine would con- sider that the information war has already been won and that they could cease their efforts. Everyone understands that Russia’s information aggression will continue adapting to new circumstances, and that it is of the utmost importance to continue fighting against it. 

## Lesson 10: The West needs to catch up with Ukraine
When it comes to Western partners, Ukraini- ans would like to see them doing what Ukraine has been doing during the last decade: taking Russian disinformation seriously and actively resisting it. Concerns persist among Ukrainians regarding the success of Russian disinformation abroad. As a nation under attack, they also propose an “Information Ramstein” to pro- vide support not just in the form of weapons but also in the information space. Ultimately, Ukrainian civil society remains reliant on support from the West. 

## Introduction

Ukraine has by far the most experience in coun- tering Kremlin disinformation, facing Russian aggression both in the military and in the infor- mation domain. Ukrainians have experienced firsthand how information aggression trans- forms into real-life, kinetic aggression, and how the latter is facilitated and justified by informa- tion aggression.
Ukraine has been on the front line of Russia’s information aggression ever since the Euro- maidan revolution and Revolution of Dignity in late 2013 and early 2014. The “most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare”^1 has transformed into an information war of attrition that has been ongoing for a decade. Throughout this time, Ukrainians have gained vital experi- ence and fine-tuned their best practices. Many Western observers started paying greater attention to Ukraine’s fight in the infor- mation space after 24 February 2022. Russia’s full-scale invasion (FSI) was accompanied by genocidal rhetoric targeted towards domestic Russian audiences,^2 and information operations aiming to paralyze both Ukrainian resistance and international support for Ukraine. Ukrain- ians responded with tenacious resistance and inventive communication. The Ukrainian fight against Russian disinformation was so inspir- ing that many in the West started declaring Ukraine’s victory and Russia’s defeat in the information war as of early 2022 - despite the fact that Ukrainian professionals did not agree that the battle for public opinion was over.
In this report, we identify and explore best practices in Ukraine’s counter-disinformation efforts. We turned to the people who are currently the most active in countering disin- formation - particularly Ukrainians who have been working on this issue since 2014. The long- est-serving “information warriors” are in civil society, but the government has also played a crucial role since the start of the invasion.
We conducted these interviews aiming to identify the lessons learnt during the period that followed the FSI. However, as many inter- viewees highlighted, these lessons are largely the result of an ongoing evolution in Ukraine ever since Euromaidan. Thus, in a sense, this report is a summary of the lessons learnt and best practices gathered in Ukraine in the last decade. It also shows how long experience and solid preparation contribute to information defence in the case of a hot conflict: whereas the Ukrainian response in 2014 lacked prepa- ration, the response after the FSI shows what a difference several years of dedicated effort countering information aggression can make. We sought to focus on those aspects of the Ukrainian counter-disinformation effort that might be the most distinctive compared to current practices in the West. In doing so, we aimed to arrive at ten lessons that could be the most inspiring for Europeans and North Ameri- cans working within the information domain. 

## Methodology and terminology

This report is based on 22 interviews with Ukrainian professionals working to counter Russian disinformation, propaganda and infor- mation aggression targeting both Ukrainian and foreign audiences. The professionals represent the governmental sector, both civilian and mili- tary, the non-governmental sector, private busi- ness, and the media. All but two of the inter- views were conducted with individuals; in two cases, there were multiple interviewees from the same institution. The interviewees and their affiliations are listed below. We asked them about their experience with Russian disinfor- mation in the post-FSI period, their views on its success, and the various ways to combat it. Around half of the interviews were conducted by the authors of this study in person in Kyiv in May 2023, while the other half took place online in June 2023. A majority (15) of the interviews were conducted in English and the remaining seven in Ukrainian. The interviews lasted from 40 to 120 minutes, totalling approximately 26 hours. All the interviews, apart from two with representatives of the intelligence community, were recorded and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper. By going through the text, we identi- fied key lessons and recurring themes through- out the hundreds of pages of transcription. We subsequently examined how Ukrainians think and work to combat disinformation and propaganda differently from the West. The anal- ysis was driven by the following main research question: What are the key lessons for coun- tering Russia’s disinformation? We then worked to identify factors that have led to Ukraine’s     success in confronting disinformation, as well as best practices that could serve as inspiration for the West. As such, this report does not focus per se on tabulating Ukrainian institutions and actors involved in this work. For readers inter- ested in such a description, the authors recom- mend the report by FOI, Ukraine’s Information Front. Strategic Communication During Russia’s Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine.^3 Their work also includes extensive desk research and a list of secondary sources.
In this report, we focus on the interviews and use secondary sources only in exceptional cases. We shift the focus away from the institutional division of labour - first, because the institu- tional environment in Ukraine is still developing and might not be the most inspiring aspect of the Ukrainian response for other countries; sec- ond, because of the prevalent overlap and its organic, loose, and slightly disorganized nature, as we explore below.
The focus of the report is on Ukraine’s efforts to counter the Kremlin’s disinformation rather than a deep dive into the narratives spread by the Kremlin’s disinformation machine. For those interested in the content and aims of Russia’s information aggression, the authors recommend the February 2023 DFRLab report, Undermining Ukraine: How the Kremlin employs informa- tion operations to erode global confidence in Ukraine , edited by Roman Osadchuk, one of the authors of this report.^4 All individual statements in this report are based either on direct quotes or on a synthe- sis of the interviews, namely a summary of the   most frequently repeated points and principles as the authors recorded them. If requested, the quotes used in the report were cleared by the interviewees prior to publication.
A brief note on terminology: practitioners interviewed for this report often used certain words informally or interchangeably, some- times at variance with traditional dictionary definitions. These include _disinformation, prop- aganda, fakes, conspiracies, information oper- ations, information-psychological operations, information attack, and information aggression._ Interviewees did not offer definitions for these terms or draw specific boundaries between them.^5 While the conversational approach to these engagements might not be strictly aca- demic, the context in which the interviewees used these terms provided insights into their thinking. Moreover, their prioritization of action over theory resulted in a situation in which their descriptions were ultimately more developed than dictionary definitions.
Where possible, the authors tried to stick to three basic terms: disinformation, understood as false information spread deliberately with the intention to deceive; propaganda, understood as information, sometimes biased or misleading, used to promote a political cause or interest;^6 and information aggression, an umbrella term that covers most of the terms mentioned in the previous paragraph, plus various active meas- ures facilitating the impact of information oper- ations (e.g., creating proxies, fake civil society or using agents within the adversary’s camp).^7

## LESSON 1: Laying a solid foundation is fundamental

The whole effort of countering information aggression starts with the simplest tasks: extensive monitoring of the information space in conjunction with rapid countering, refuting, or debunking of false information. One basic principle noted by interviewees is that it is more important to act quickly than to contemplate whether action is necessary and which action or actor would be the right one.
These principles seem to be in stark contrast to those in many European countries, where such monitoring units are often underfunded and understaffed,^9 or where the common refrain is that “debunking doesn’t work”.^10 The profes- sionals in Ukraine would appear to think differ- ently, as the debate largely concerns whether everything should be debunked as quickly as possible, or whether there are more marginal stories that can be merely monitored, without further reaction. Success also requires many other actions to be taken. These are discussed below.
Each relevant government and military insti- tution has its own methods for monitoring the information space for disinformation narratives.
This situational awareness work is strengthened by the monitoring conducted by the Ukrainian government’s Center for Countering Disinfor- mation (CCD) and the Centre for Strategic Com- munications (CSC), alongside monitoring work conducted by various non-governmental actors.
“When we work in a coordinated and fast man- ner, disinformation is detected very quickly and reliably, and it’s possible to react to it quickly,” said Taras Dzyuba of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The aim of the whole monitoring system is not only to detect false information swiftly, but also to respond swiftly.
Interviewees did not seem to be concerned about possible overlaps in monitoring efforts conducted by various government bodies and NGOs. They considered it safer to have more actors seeing the same piece of information, rather than risking it falling through the cracks.
In fact, situations in which multiple monitoring observers see the same problem in the infor- mation space make their detection efforts more reliable, a principle we will discuss in more detail in Lesson 3.
The crucial role of extensive monitoring and detection will also be touched upon in Lesson 5, where we discuss whether those who monitored the information domain observed any indica- tions of the full-scale invasion before 24 Feb- ruary 2022. The key point is that it is critical to constantly monitor as much as possible. With- out exhaustive monitoring to identify patterns and potential outliers, including in peacetime, it becomes impossible to notice a deviation from the norm, such as a sudden increase in a par- ticular disinformation narrative.
Gaps in monitoring can also lead to threats.
“The enemy’s special services are engaged in IPSO (informational and psychological special operation), which is a specific activity in terms of planning, implementation, and monitoring.
  So our special services should be engaged in appropriate countermeasures,” said Oleksandra Tsekhanovska, a Ukrainian expert in countering disinformation. She continued:   “And such counteraction is only possible through constant monitoring, including quantitative data to detect the pre- paratory stage. Because when the IPSO reaches the audience, it’s already too late. That’s why it’s very difficult for me to determine which internal conflicts, such as those we’re currently experiencing in Ukraine, are entirely or partly the result of the activities of the Russian special ser- vices, and which are a natural reaction to the stressful events, to the imperfection of our political system, or other factors.”

More often than not, whenever false information is identified, it is countered (i.e., debunked) in some way as soon as possible. There have even been phases when this rule has been applied in 100% of identified cases such as when the many months of military buildup and threatening rhetoric from the Russian side started being accompanied by false stories^11 about alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory in the final weeks before 24 February. Accompanied by increasing reports of the imminent FSI, these disinformation campaigns were perceived by Ukrainians as Russian attempts to create a justification for war similar to the Gleiwitz incident, the false-flag operation conducted by Nazi     Germany immediately prior to its 1939 invasion of Poland. Ukraine’s strategy was therefore to officially debunk even the most absurd accusations as publicly as possible.
> “When you realize that they can use any marginal story to create a casus belli, you understand that the risks of not refuting it are much higher than the risks of inadvertently boosting a stupid marginal story. So we decided to refute everything, absolutely everything. I remember that we had to make Minister Dmytro Kuleba refute another crazy Russian story on his Twitter every two or three hours,” said Gosha Tykhyi, advisor to Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba.
> Similarly, interviewees from the Center for Countering Disinformation highlighted the rapid debunking of each and every Russian fake through every relevant government spokesperson as the key principle they followed at the time and the most important factor in ensuring that no fakes got out of control.
> “Just as quickly as these fakes surfaced, the response was equally fairly quick. Every centre, every NGO, even our president, everybody was constantly reaching out on television or any other information source, debunking everything and explaining what had happened. This is the crux of how we are surviving these informational attacks,” said one CCD official.
> This principle was also instrumental in the first hours after the FSI. The situation was chaotic, and even some information professionals were shaken by reports that the Ukrainian leadership had fled the country. For some interviewees, the famous “We are here”^12 video of President Zelensky and his team a rapid refutation of the Russian lies claiming that the country’s leadership had fled was the point at which they concluded that the fight for the information space was an absolute and ongoing imperative.
Debunking lies is not in itself a sufficient condition in the counter-disinformation fight: it is not enough to counter the threat. However, it is a necessary condition: without it, it is just not possible to counter disinformation successfully.
Debunking also serves an important secondary role, enabling the maintenance of a database of cases and tactics used by Russia, which serves as a template for subsequent prebunking measures. While Ukrainians face new false narratives and disinformation every day, it becomes easier to disregard them, since they have already seen similar cases debunked in the past. Thus, databases of previously debunked disinformation cases, even when scattered across multiple entities, platforms, and websites, provide rapid informational immunity against further influence and disinformation campaigns. In less tense situations, it is possible to focus on refuting only the most relevant stories and lies that have the potential to cause harm, and to start using other tools in the toolbox, such as discrediting the sources spreading disinformation, as discussed below.
>   As mentioned previously by Gosha Tykhyi, the downside of debunking a story can be that it gives a less important story the visibility that it would not otherwise receive. To counter this, Ukrainian AI startup LetsData provides alerts telling clients when not to debunk a story: “We are literally alerting people by saying: Please don’t touch it. If it starts developing, we’ll let you know. But for now, it isn’t, so just leave it alone,” said LetsData co-founder Ksenia Iliuk.
However, the urge to respond, at least in some form, is deeply ingrained in the mindset of Ukrainian practitioners, and points to another basic principle of the Ukrainian response that seems to contradict that of many European countries: the prioritization of rapid action over slower deliberation and procedures. It seems that many counter-disinformation professionals in Ukraine consider that it is more important to act rapidly in some way, even if the action is imperfect, and refine the response along the way, rather than endlessly contemplating whether action is necessary, whether it is the right one, or whether some other actor should take the initiative instead. This would only allow the aggressor to conduct their operations unopposed.
When interviewing CCD officials and discussing how some Western actors find reacting to disinformation stories too laborious, while refuting or debunking lies is generally the norm in Ukraine, one official responded, “This might not correspond with what you would like to hear, but we have the idea that any kind of communication is better than no communication at all.”   This is not to say that communication is not thought through, however. Practitioners discussed how they evaluate various data showing the impact of their messages and try to refine the messaging based on these data. However, it seems that when facing a new situation, their instinct is always to react in some way and only later, when the situation is calmer and less urgent, to evaluate whether the reaction could be better next time. This results in much trial and error, which necessarily involves tolerance for mistakes.
The principle of prioritizing action over excessive contemplation can also be perceived in the debates on the success, or lack thereof, of Russian information operations. This will be discussed more broadly in Lesson 9. However, another difference between the Ukrainian and Western approaches should be highlighted here.
In the West, it is common to encounter the mindset that because we are not always sure of the impact or success of malign actors’ disinformation efforts, there is no need to “overreact”.
The Ukrainian approach to disinformation is   exactly the opposite. Ukrainian practitioners generally agreed that although it is almost impossible to accurately measure the impact of disinformation operations, they do not consider this a reason to constrain their responses.
On the contrary, if it remains uncertain how much damage malign actors have caused or could cause in the future, every effort must be made to minimize the damage, including rapid responses.
These basic principles that the information space needs to be thoroughly monitored to a point where overlap is common or even encouraged; that instances of disinformation require a response, even from the highest level; and that it is necessary to act rather than hesitate might appear practically fundamental to many Ukrainian counter-disinformation professionals.
However, these principles do not seem to be broadly accepted among Western practitioners.
It is for this very reason that we felt it necessary to highlight them and their role as a foundation for subsequent counter-disinformation efforts.
> Taking the basic tasks very seriously leads to another principle of the Ukrainian response: the country as a whole devotes significant resources to the counter-disinformation fight, throwing big numbers into the arena. Without these resources, extensive monitoring and rapid response efforts would simply not be possible.
We are not just talking about human resources, financial resources, or the number of institutions and organizations that are active in the information battle, although these numbers often exceed corresponding resources in many European countries. It is also about the number of different measures attempted, the number of channels used, and the successful dissemination of coordinated messaging involving multiple speakers across multiple audiences.
The extensive number of actors and activities involved in Ukrainian counter-disinformation efforts naturally also creates competition, often leading to multiple narrative options to choose from, increasing the likelihood of successful public engagement. Quantity therefore serves not only as a defensive measure, but as an offensive measure that creates better narrative “weapons” in the information domain. Thanks to the considerable number of resources available to Ukrainian counter-disinformation practitioners, Ukraine can detect more threats over a shorter time span, develop multiple options that result in higher-quality communication products, and reach larger audiences more quickly.
Many interviewees noted that the number of actors involved in counter-disinformation work had increased significantly since the Revolution   of Dignity in 2013–2014. Initially, this emerged mainly in the non-governmental sector, later expanding within state structures as well. Notably, the Ukrainian government drew heavily on the expertise of civil society and media actors, including Liubov Tsybulska, Ihor Solovey and Gosha Tykhyi. Civil society continues to play a leading role in counter-disinformation efforts.
“During Euromaidan, there was a scarcity of voices,” said Alya Shandra, editor-in-chief at Euromaidan Press. “Today there is a wide, active and coordinated Ukrainian Twitter ecosystem dispelling Russian disinformation.” Texty editorin-chief Roman Kulchynsky added, “Civil society was fully involved even before the FSI. Thanks to them, the people knew what Russian disinformation was and didn’t trust it.” Ihor Solovey, head of the Centre for Strategic Communications, also noted that ever since the Euromaidan revolution, more and more projects countering disinformation had emerged over the years as various civil society actors worked together in different segments across the information ecosystem. “This magnitude saved Ukraine in many respects,” Solovey stated.
The importance and advantages of a plurality of actors were indirectly confirmed by some disagreements among the interviewees. Some saw no successful Russian influence in the Ukrainian information space, while others convincingly described the Kremlin’s obvious successes. Some interviewees did not see any prepared disinformation activities before the FSI or during the initial days afterwards, while many others documented multiple instances, such as the mushrooming of dedicated,
hyperlocal Telegram channels that started spreading Russian propaganda as if on com- mand in multiple Ukrainian cities.
The lesson is obvious - the more actors looking at the information space from various perspectives, the smaller the probability that some crucial development or threats will go unnoticed.
Apart from organizations that had been working on this topic in a systematic man- ner years before the FSI - StopFake, Detector Media, Ukrainian Crisis Media Centre, Internews, and Texty, among many others^13 - there was a massive boom in volunteer activity after 24 February 2022. “I can’t even imagine how many people joined these efforts,” said hybrid threat expert Liubov Tsybulska.
  “When the war started, I was getting so many messages, requests from people I didn’t know. They were just texting, ‘I’m sitting in the shelter, what can I do, I have a phone, I have a laptop, I can just text something on YouTube, I can go to Russian websites, some forums, whatever, and spread information there – just give me the messages’.”  These activities involved individual activists as well as civil society groups and private busi- nesses. Some were loosely connected, while others were more organized as a form of “territorial defence” for the information space.
    Regardless of their background or organiza- tional structure, they take on a number of tasks, including debunking false information and disseminating truthful information, calling out Russian and pro-Russian voices, and mon- itoring the information space, with some even engaging in sophisticated cyberattacks against targets in Russia.
The combined resources of the Ukrainian media were also pooled towards one goal. The Ukrainian government established “United News telethon”, a joint effort of various national chan- nels that started broadcasting on 24 February  2022. The channel provided verified information, serving as a crucial source for the Ukrainian public at the beginning of the invasion. At the time of publishing this report in early 2024, it is still active, although some experts no longer see the need for such a format.^14     Apart from civil society and the media, the government also deployed more resources.
“Compared to the pre-war situation, our activ- ities have multiplied and we have intensified measures to detect information aggression as well as measures to counter it,” an SSU official said.
    In collaboration with the CCD, the authors of this report worked to calculate the num- ber of government stakeholders involved in Ukraine’s counter-disinformation efforts. While it is difficult to estimate the total number of civil servants working on this topic, it is likely to be in the high hundreds. Even more difficult is   tabulating how many NGOs and volunteers are participating. “Half the country got involved,” remarked political scientist Vadym Denysenko.
The sheer number of institutions and individ- uals engaged in counter-disinformation activ- ities has led to these efforts spreading across countless channels, both online and offline. “If the government wants to counter disinforma- tion, it should try to be everywhere,” said Volod- ymyr Yermolenko, president of PEN Ukraine and editor-in-chief of UkraineWorld. “Go to these platforms and the influencers already there and try to work with them.” As an example of civil society cooperation, he described how col- leagues at Internews had approached YouTube influencers. Internews specialists provided the content, he explained, while influencers used their reputation to disseminate content coun- tering Russian propaganda to wider audiences.
Hybrid threat expert Liubov Tsybulska described how communicators from Ukraine’s armed forces followed shifts in the platform behaviour of the Ukrainian public, leading to them increasing their output on Telegram.
Ksenia Iliuk of LetsData highlighted how the government started amplifying content from African TikTok users to counter stories accusing the country of racism against African students.
Armed Forces of Ukraine representative Taras Dzyuba even mentioned how young Ukrainians used online games like World of Tanks to show- case Russian losses on the battlefield: “They didn’t expect us to break into the whole infor- mation space and show the losses to the whole world, including the Russian population. This involved magnitude [in terms of scale], creativ- ity, and the element of surprise for the enemy.”


  Relatedly, practitioners remained mindful of the need to target many different audiences. Regular exercises and education programmes designed to raise awareness about Russian disinformation are conducted by relevant centres for military and security personnel, for government officials, and for local government employees.
Another important element is the need to keep repeating the message. “You have to deliver content every day,” said security reporter Maria Avdeeva. “You can’t just put up a list of fake news channels and expect people to remember it; you have to repeat the message on a daily basis.” Interviewees also mentioned that this repetition mechanism works for Russia too, as researchers have noted in previous stud- ies.^15 To help combat this, Ukrainian diplomats look for opportunities whereby international partners can amplify Ukrainian messaging and debunking efforts, helping them reach an even wider audience.
Despite the quantity of resources that Ukraine devotes to combatting disinformation, which, as previously noted, seems to be far greater than anywhere in the West given the mass mobilization involved, key players still feel outnumbered by Russia’s disinformation machine. “We don’t have the resources that the Russians have,” a CCD interviewee explained, noting how Ukrainian counter-disinformation efforts are less active in much of the world, including Africa, Latin America and Asia. Liubov Tsybulska also described how the Ukrainian government relies upon additional support from civil society because “they didn’t - and still don’t - have the necessary resources. They are not comparable to the threat”.
  Taras Dzyuba also described outnumbering of a different kind: broadcast infrastructure. “Our biggest transmitters in Donbas had 10-kilo- watt capacity, so the Russians built 30-kilowatt transmitters,” he said. “They increased the capacity, they increased the number of channels.
The technical capabilities determine a lot.” The numbers can also have a negative conno- tation - in cases where Ukraine did not allocate the necessary resources, Russia successfully filled the informational vacuum. “In the initial days of the war, some of the Russian _vbrosy_^16 spread like wildfire on Telegram. When informa- tion is scarce, propagandists have the upper  16 Literally a “throw in”, meaning the initial sowing of the seed of disinformation at the beginning of a campaign.
  hand,” said Alya Shandra of Euromaidan Press.
This also confirms the principle highlighted in Lesson 1: It is better to communicate in some way, rather than allow the adversary to be the only one filling the information space.
While Ukraine continues to dedicate sig- nificantly more resources to countering dis- information than most European countries, practitioners acknowledged that Russia out- spends them, and that the ongoing challenge is so demanding that more resources will be required.
  Given the large number of actors involved in countering disinformation, an important ques- tion arises: How do they coordinate with each other, and how do practitioners ensure that their activities do not overlap? The answer to the second part of the ques- tion might be surprising. There is no need to avoid overlap at all; in fact, many interviewees perceived the overlap as a positive outcome, with undeniable advantages such as more robust monitoring, independence, creativity, rapid response times, and potential safeguards against failures by individual actors.
When it comes to coordination, the prevail- ing mindset favours a lack of formal procedures and an overall non-bureaucratic approach to countering disinformation. Indeed, coordination is not very rigid, either between civil society organizations, or between the government and civil society (see Lesson 4 below).
Coordination in countering disinformation existed even before the FSI. There were two unifying forces - under the umbrella of the NDI Disinformation Hub and in cooperation with the Centre for Strategic Communications. “The eco- system of people dealing with Russian disinfor- mation was created a while ago, and it became a self-coordinating group to which people added trusted contacts. The group discussed what Russia is pushing through and what we can say [in response],” explained security expert Maria Avdeeva.
On 24 February, the situation changed dra- matically, as many new people and organiza- tions wanted to help combat Russian aggres- sion in the information sphere. “Small groups organized themselves, found each other and




did something. Naturally, they made a lot of mistakes, so it was organic,” noted political scientist Vadym Denysenko. New alliances and groups started emerging from the grassroots  - people coordinated with each other, creating volunteer chats focusing on everything from debunking Russian disinformation, collecting evidence of Russian war crimes, sharing tips on how to help foreign journalists, communicating with foreign audiences with truthful information on the ground, and creating visuals such as caricatures and posters. “The ‘elf’^17 communities organized themselves in the first days of the invasion,” said Odesa-based journalist Evgenia Genova.
    People from NGOs, governmental bodies, and businesses worked together as if structural boundaries did not exist. No one controlled or could control this process, as people organized themselves into small cells based on personal contacts, acquaintances, or even recommendations without really knowing each other. “That was a very valuable and unique moment when we started working together,” noted Liubov Tsybulska. “We always compare ourselves to a beehive. We are like bees, we know exactly where to fly and who to sting.” Many independent groups united over the shared purpose of deflecting Russian information aggression without necessarily having a single decision-making centre, organically creating a decentralized ecosystem.
    This approach helped the Ukrainians in their fight against Russian disinformation. “We avoid a vertical approach. If we went through procedures, it would be slow and require approval from multiple people, and threat and risk analyses. The rapid horizontal work allows us to do things at speed and with great quality,” said Taras Dzyuba. This absence of procedural approval was in stark contrast to the Kremlin’s tactics: in the first months of the invasion, Russia was not prepared to be flexible in its communication and lagged behind after the initial invasion plan failed.
In small and informal groups, much depends on the personal initiative of many individuals, which was encouraged, not discouraged. The creative potential of these groups was unlimited and unrestrained thanks to the absence of a lengthy formal approval process, making them flexible and highly adaptable to the rapidly changing landscape of the war - again, in contrast to Russia’s unwieldy and centralised propaganda machine.
The tactic of multiple groups working together in the same sphere is not without problems, however. The effort created some overlap due to the absence of intergroup communication, leading to some clusters working on the same issues or topics independently, producing content debunking the same disinformation narratives, and creating redundancy that might have been avoided with better coordination. “The problem is that most of the agencies, including civil society, are acting based on gut instincts,” noted LetsData’s Ksenia Iliuk.
     However, most of our interviewees highlighted that the duplication of effort was not a fault but a feature. While some topics indeed received considerable attention, this structure and volume allowed Ukrainian civil society to cover more issues and amplify the Ukrainian voice. When several groups reach the same conclusion regarding a disinformation campaign, such as the false Stinger systems trade and the arrest of Ukrainians in Germany,^18 the findings are more reliable. Similarly, when actors using different tools and methods reach similar conclusions, the findings will be more persuasive for readers.
The overlap also creates a safety net: if any of the groups or entities are offline or overlook something, others pick up the slack. The whole system is thus more resilient in the event of any actor facing problems, ranging from relocation and blackouts to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and loss of equipment. At the same time, it becomes harder for Russia to disrupt such a decentralized network, as there is no single hub for Russia to destroy and paralyze Ukraine’s ability to counter disinformation and propaganda.
At first glance, it may seem that loose coordination, independent actors, and the chaotic nature of the ecosystem are a major handicap in the fight against a massive and organized propaganda machine. However, the post-FSI   situation in Ukraine shows that the advantages can outweigh the disadvantages. Such a loose and decentralized network, unencumbered by rigid procedures, has a quicker reaction time, reaches a wider range of audiences, engages civic activists who would be discouraged by formal and bureaucratic procedures, and fosters   creativity and spontaneity - both of which are crucial in the battle for the information space.
Moreover, it helps achieve scale (see Lesson 2); more actors experiment with their own distinct approaches, each of which might work for a different target audience.
  The large number of actors involved in countering disinformation has another secondary effect: the government has the luxury of working with a very vibrant civil society, and the opportunity to attract some of the most outstanding and tested individuals to the civil service, pick the most successful projects and organizations for cooperation, and fill the gaps that the government alone cannot fill. Russian disinformation is too broad and fast-changing for the government, while it is too deep and systemic for civil society – by working together, both sectors can help each other achieve their common goal.
This process first became prevalent in 2014 when people from civil society organizations started playing an important role in policy, sometimes moving directly into government.
The cooperation after the FSI helped Ukraine counter disinformation more effectively, reach a bigger audience, and enable the government and NGOs to be more successful in their work.
Since 2014, Ukraine has faced an immense hybrid war with Russia, in which it has needed to fight in both the kinetic and information realms, as is evident from the many “explanations” that Putin^19 presented^20 for the war, based on long-running disinformation campaigns. In the information domain, the Kremlin

outstripped Ukraine in capacity^21 and funding,^22
with RT and Sputnik freely operating worldwide
in multiple languages before the 2022 invasion.
In 2014, the Kremlin barraged the interna-
tional information space with messages about
a “failed state”, “Ukrainian aggression,” and a
number^23 of MH-17 conspiracy theories, with
the Ukrainian government unable to address
all the false allegations in an effective manner.
Therefore, to meet the need, multiple initiatives
and actors appeared on the scene to counter
Russian disinformation. Since then, civil society
has emerged as an influential player, debunking
false messaging and duly assisting the govern-
ment. This cooperation between civil society
and the government has benefitted Ukraine by
allowing it to respond to multiple threats. “It
wasn’t led from top to bottom; very often it was
a bottom-up drive. It’s important to underline
that this [cooperation] wasn’t something that
just appeared in response to the Russian FSI; a
lot of work had been done since 2014,” journal-
ist and Chatham House Academy fellow Olga
Tokariuk pointed out.
“No country can deal with such an enormous
amount of information without harnessing the
capability of civil society,” noted CSC’s Ihor
Solovey. The problem is far-reaching and there

## LESSON 4: Cherish the role of civil society


is no simple solution. Moreover, the government
and civil society have different remits, audi-
ences, and levels of flexibility, allowing them to
complement each other. “Civil society organiza-
tions are more flexible and sensitive, and have
an audience that the government would never
have,” Solovey added.
Civil society organizations can independently
reach out to social media platforms with
requests to protect user data, but the same
request coming from the government would
have a different impact. Alternatively, govern-
mental bodies cannot detect every single infor-
mation campaign at both local and national lev-
els, which is why NGOs, which are more attuned
to local topics, are better suited to cover that
front while helping the government identify
the societal cracks exploited by Russia. Broadly
speaking, cooperation between civil society and
government was often flexible and informal,
allowing it to focus on specific, organic prob-
lem-solving rather than the creation of formal
and systematic procedures for collaboration.
Capacity expanded even further when the
Ukrainian government created two entities to
counter disinformation in March, 2021: the Cen-
tre for Strategic Communications within the
Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and
the Center for Countering Disinformation within
the National Security and Defence Council. In
particular, the CSC communicated with civil
society from its inception, understanding the
immense importance of the expertise concen-
trated in the non-governmental sector.
The cooperation opened up new ways to
counter disinformation, but it did not imply
interdependence or a vertical relationship.


Instead, it was built on the principle of horizon-
tal cooperation, whereby partners could amplify
each other’s work by sharing their expertise and
findings, or through joint programmes, training,
and problem-solving.
“This war is the greatest illustration of the
cooperation between government and society,
and it works on all fronts. It’s just on an ad hoc
basis, mainly like a partnership or a connection
between friends,” said Artem Starosiek, CEO of
Molfar OSINT Community.
For example, government bodies use NGO
monitoring and research to adjust their policies.
“We used LetsData materials to develop policy
documents and recommendations,” said CSC
chief Ihor Solovey. LetsData’s Ksenia Iliuk added:


“Civil society was generating a lot of very
good content that didn’t actually debunk,
but literally destroyed so many narratives
and everything in a very creative, very
appealing way. I think the best thing that
the state did in this regard was to amplify
that.”


This dynamic worked both ways. According
to Alyona Hryshko of Internews Ukraine:


“Government bodies monitor the situation,
and their official representatives share
information with civil society organiza-
tions. We then relay this information to
our audience, highlighting some details
about the current situation on the bat-
tlefield or other information we’ve gained
during the information war.”


Some interviewees suggested that structuring
this cooperation might benefit all actors and
make it more efficient. However, such action
would require additional time and effort - a
difficult task during wartime - and could lead
to duplication of effort and miscommunication.
Moreover, civil society and government are not
monolithic structures, but are composed of
various actors: some are open to partners, while
others are not. “There’s an opportunity to coop-
erate based on personal agreements. We aren’t


trying to provide something for the government
or engage in joint projects, but if there’s a will,
there’s an opportunity to do so,” noted Roman
Kulchynsky.
“Governmental institutions are made up of
different people. Only those institutions that
were led by people who were open to and inter-
ested in cooperation demonstrated a high level
of involvement,” said counter-disinformation
expert Oleksandra Tsekhanovska.


Disinformation campaigns and the resilience
required to resist them do not develop over-
night. Instead, they emerge and evolve over
time, but catalyze even further in extreme
circumstances, such as an invasion. Russia has
continued to attack Ukraine in the information
space since at least 2013,^24 making some pat-
terns stand out. When information attacks are
predictable, it is possible to plan in advance
how to respond to them.
Ukrainian government bodies stepped up
their preparations as intelligence sources,
civil society monitoring, and media report-
ing revealed increasing signs of an attack.^25
To confront such a problem, it was necessary
to plan not just general contingency proce-
dures, such as splitting the office into multiple
groups in different regions, but also specific
prepared messages and instruments that could
be deployed at short notice. This preparation
included informing Ukrainian society of the
impending danger. Government officials pre-
pared materials on what people should do in
case of an emergency.^26 “Even if the risk is low,
you need to prepare your people for what to
do in case of trouble,” said Petro Burkovskyi,
executive director of the Democratic Initiatives
Foundation.
According to adviser Gosha Tykhyi from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA):

“We developed such a plan in summer
2021, which was written down and put
into effect by the minister, and we basi-
cally had it in place. The plan prescribed
specific algorithms, specific actions for
various members of the team, for differ-
ent departments, what everyone should
do, how everyone should coordinate, how
we would communicate if there was no
mobile connection, how we would main-
tain the lines.”


This suggests that the state agency had multi-
ple tools at its disposal that could be enacted
in multiple scenarios, which streamlined MFA
activities and helped to avert chaos in the crit-
ical first days after the invasion. “If we hadn’t
done that, I think we would have descended into
chaos because on the first day of the invasion, it
wasn’t possible to really think much because the
workload was so heavy that you needed some
things prepared in advance,” Tykhyi added.
The availability of official information is
crucial for people in the first moments of an
emergency because an information vacuum can
always be filled by conspiracies, disinformation,
or information operations conducted by the
adversary.
Some state services analyzed where people
were getting their information from and created
official accounts on the main social media plat-
forms used by citizens.

## LESSON 5: Preparation is essential, but not a panacea



“When this tension began around the war,
with Russian troops on our border, the
STRATCOM units within the armed forces
had already launched new Telegram chan-
nels. These channels were ready when the
FSI started, and they informed citizens
that they had people who would update
them all the time, every two minutes,” said
Liubov Tsybulska.

The lesson for governmental communicators is
this: be where your audiences are, rather than
forcing them to search for information buried
on platforms that suit you. If you fail to do that,
people might consume adversarial messages
there instead.
Despite all the possible preparations for and
simulations of future events, it is impossible to
predict everything accurately. Our interviewees
agreed that the first days of war unleashed
chaos in multiple areas of life, including com-
munication. “Because of the general chaos in
the first days of the invasion, there was very
little official information about what was hap-
pening, so people mainly got all kinds of infor-
mation from Telegram channels,” said Maria
Avdeeva.
Even the most sophisticated plans cannot be
followed blindly because the situation might
change swiftly. The plans should be an initial
step and pointer, not untouchable dogma, to
avoid getting mired in an ineffective way of
action. Multiple interviewees highlighted that
the Russians had inefficient communications
from the very start of the invasion because their
information campaigns were inflexible. “Rus-
sians operate according to a plan,” said armed


forces representative Taras Dzyuba. “If they
plan military aggression, they have a plan for an
information operation or campaign. They need
many different approvals, and they won’t adjust
operations, even if they see the need.” Effective
communication therefore requires a plan,
but allows for flexible handling of real-time
events and deviation from the original plan if
warranted.
Finally, initial plans may not always ade-
quately assess all risks. Many interviewees said
that even when they saw some indicators of the
impending war, they had not anticipated the
sheer scale of the invasion. LetsData’s Ksenia
Iliuk noted: “We had quite a lot of indicators.
But I think personally, when interpreting them
as a Ukrainian, I was trying to find reasons why
something was not an indicator of a full-scale
invasion.”


“We had the facts, and everything pointed
to a war. Not just a Donbas war, but a
total invasion, including from the north.
And people were trying to hide from these
facts, immerse themselves in wishful
thinking, and come up with all sorts of
theories about what was happening,” said
PEN Ukraine Volodymyr Yermolenko.


These indicators included a dramatic increase
in negative coverage of Ukraine in the Russian
domestic media. “A year before the invasion, we
observed an increase in the amount of time and
the number of messages dedicated to Ukraine,
which was portrayed as ‘anti-Russian’,” said
Ruslan Deynychenko. “It was a sign that they
wanted to create an image of the enemy, not


just of Ukraine, but also of the West, the Euro-
pean Union, NATO, and the United States.”^27
Another important indicator was the number
of Russian officials promoting hostile messag-
ing. Multiple Ukrainian experts highlighted the
importance of Putin’s pre-invasion article, “On
the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukraini-
ans”,^28 which was riddled with false and mislead-
ing narratives.^29 The article normalized extrem-
ist rhetoric against Ukraine among high-level
Russian officials, who repeated similar messages
in their own statements.
“We observed attempts to discredit Ukrainian
leadership, including messages about the inabil-
ity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to repel the
Russian army,” said Taras Dzyuba, echoing Gosha
Tykhyi’s comments in Lesson 1. “Also, one month
before the invasion, Russians started coming up
with _casus belli_ almost every day, trying to find
a reason to start the war.”

27 Hybrid CoE also covered the shifts in the Kremlin’s messaging prior to the invasion: Kalenský, Jakub.

These pre-invasion changes in the tone and
volume of messages highlight the importance
of monitoring efforts, as previously discussed.
Detecting a change in narrative tone or quantity
entails establishing what constitutes the norm
to begin with and remaining vigilant.
Sometimes, however, changes in tone and
volume are not perceived as serious or are sim-
ply not taken account until it is too late due to
what is known as assessment bias. “We asked
the people what they were thinking on the eve
of the invasion, and 46% said that they didn’t
expect war,” said Petro Burkovskyi, based on a
poll from March 2023. “Another 29% said they
believed the war could happen, but didn’t want
to believe it until it began.” This suggests the
significance of assessment bias, which should
be mitigated when devising polls. One approach
is to prepare for multiple gradations of an
incoming emergency, ranging from optimis-
tic options to the most pessimistic ones. This
would allow actors to avoid nasty surprises,
mitigate chaos to some extent, and gain a head
start from the outset.


Although Ukraine is doing a tremendous
amount of work, with both the state and civil
society dedicating unprecedented resources
to monitoring, documenting, debunking, and
raising awareness about hostile disinforma-
tion through a plethora of channels, there is
yet another group of countermeasures against
information aggressors: efforts to punish and
deter their activities, and limit their capability
to cause harm. Some interviewees even consid-
ered this line of work the most important.
In 2014, Ukraine banned Russian state TV
channels.^30 In 2017, Petro Poroshenko’s adminis-
tration blocked access to Russian social media
VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, to a Russian
mail provider and search engine, and to several
pseudo-media sites;^31 this measure was later
extended by Volodymyr Zelensky.^32 In 2021,
Zelensky’s administration banned^33 TV channels
plus their information ecosystem (websites,
social media channels, direct messaging plat-
form channels), including those that did not
directly belong to the Russian state but still
spread the same messages. These included
channels belonging to pro-Kremlin oligarch
Viktor Medvedchuk.
Every single interviewee, whether from the
government or civil society, regarded these
decisions as highly positive and crucial for
protecting the Ukrainian information space.

“We not only supported these decisions,
we actively lobbied for them,” said Ruslan
Deynychenko, executive director of StopFake.
Most of the interviewees agreed that had the
pro-Kremlin channels still been active dur-
ing the FSI, Ukrainian resistance would have
been much more difficult. “It would have been
almost impossible,” added Ihor Solovey.
Some interviewees expressed regret that
these decisions had not been taken earlier.
“The decision about Medvedchuk’s channels
even came too late,” said Anton Gerashchenko,
founder of the Ukrainian Institute for the Future
and a former Information Ministry advisor. Tex-
ty’s Roman Kulchynsky added: “We should have
adopted these decisions way sooner.” Alona
Hryshko of Internews Ukraine suggested that
Ukraine made a mistake even prior to the first
invasion in 2014 by allowing Russia to occupy
so much of the Ukrainian information and cul-
tural space. Today, she is concerned about the
situation in the temporarily occupied territories.
“Russia has a monopoly on information influ-
ence in these areas because there is no possi-
bility to receive information from the Ukrainian
side,” she stated.
The reason for this unanimous support
among interviewees for countermeasures
that are frequently considered controversial
in the West seems to be that all interviewees,

## LESSON 6: Punitive measures are a must


regardless of their background, recognized that
Kremlin-sponsored media and the channels
that help them are not actually media, but
propaganda weapons in Russia’s information
war. “They are combatants - all the restrictions
should apply to them,” said Ihor Solovey.


“The EU saw the information space as a
big marketplace where you come, sell your
goods, buy other goods, and everybody’s
happy. The Russians, on the other hand,
treated the global information space as
a battleground. It’s not a market where
you come to sell your goods. It’s a battle-
field where you shoot and you try to avoid
being shot,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko.

Olga Tokariuk added: “Not giving a platform to
people who advocate genocide against Ukraini-
ans is not a question of freedom of speech, but
of protecting human lives.”
Some Russian channels could not be blocked
by Ukraine on its own, necessitating coopera-
tion with private-sector digital platforms.

channels have been blocked. They sent

bodies. We sent them a list of channels
that we found spreading disinformation
and violating our criminal code, and
we filled in their form with information
on which Ukrainian laws a channel had
violated,” a CCD official noted.


Several government interviewees also men-
tioned that whenever they see malign actors or
propagandists involved in activities that might
violate Ukrainian law, they alert the relevant
authorities. The Security Service of Ukraine
(SSU) has also identified and shut down several
bot farms and channels involved in spreading
pro-Kremlin propaganda.^34
Outright bans and legal consequences are
the most extreme option. Some other disin-
formation channels are subject to less severe
countermeasures, such as naming and shaming.
In 2022, a number of Ukrainian ministries and
state services, including Military Intelligence
and the SSU, published a joint statement on
“The protection of Ukraine’s information space
from Russian hostile Telegram channels”.^35
They urged the public to avoid channels con-
nected to Russia, publishing a list of 100 such
channels. The CCD, in collaboration with other
state institutions, later created a blacklist^36


of “information terrorist” Telegram channels.
They also compiled a list of international influ-
encers who amplify Russian propaganda.^37
This activity did not come from the govern-
ment alone. The Institute of Mass Information
released a blacklist of people spreading geno-
cidal Russian rhetoric.^38 Vox Ukraine created a
database of Russian propaganda appearing in
European outlets.^39 Ksenia Iliuk also noted that
social media users also participated, exposing
Russian-liked channels on TikTok, among other
platforms.
As with other countermeasures, a
whole-of-society approach to imposing costs
on the aggressor was adopted, whereby certain
activities were conducted simultaneously by the
state, the media, civil society, and individuals. In
this particular context, there did not seem to

be that much concern about a possible overlap.
Rather, the attitude once again was that it is
better to do the same thing two or three times
than risk not doing it at all (see Lesson 3 on
Overlap). This is similar to how the multitude of
actors involved in these activities increase their
impact (see Lesson 2 on Numbers).
Another option entails putting public pres-
sure on propagandists. Galyna Petrenko, direc-
tor of Detector Media, mentioned the case of
Garri Knyagnitsky, who used to work for Krem-
lin outlet NTV and was later hired by Voice of
America (VOA). “The Ukrainian journalistic com-
munity did not agree with this,” Petrenko said.
“We started to write articles about it to draw
attention to the problem, and to try to reach
out to senior VOA executives.” Knyagnitsky was
subsequently dismissed by VOA.^40


Humorous content is used again and again as a
whole-of-society tool by Ukrainian government
actors, civil society, activists and influencers.
There are at least three reasons why Ukrainians
use humour to counter Russian propaganda:
to raise awareness beyond typical audiences;
to build resilience among one’s own audience;
and to impose costs on the reputation of the
aggressor.
First, humorous content reaches wider audi-
ences than “boring” content. In a contest where
adversaries vie for attention, this might be the
most important reason. According to Gosha
Tykhyi: “It’s a powerful tool for getting the
message out, because we realized that a meme
can strike a target that an MFA press release
would miss.”


“Humour is a tool that allows you to reach
audiences outside of your usual bubble.
Audiences that might not know much
about the subject, and that might not be
very interested in Ukraine. But humour,
irony, satire and memes can reach those
audiences and mobilize support from
people who would otherwise be neutral or
indifferent. Humorous content is the most
likely to go viral,” said Olga Tokariuk.

The second reason is more inwardly oriented:
humour helps build the morale of Ukrainian
citizens. People that can laugh at their enemy
are more resilient to the aggression they are
facing. “Whenever something bad happens,
I see an increased number of memes. When
people laugh, it helps them feel better,” said


Artem Starosiek. According to Evgenia Genova,
“Videos about how we’re winning, some memes,
pictures, numbers from the General Staff. Any-
thing that boosted optimism was cool. People
decided that somehow they needed it.” Olga
Tokariuk added, “It can help prolong the feeling
of empathy and support by opening up another
emotional channel, so that people don’t just
feel desperation and negative emotions con-
nected to what is happening in Ukraine; they
also feel hopeful and confident that Ukrainians
can win.”
Third, humour helps to discredit, ridicule and
mock the enemy. It undermines the credibility
of the Kremlin and its propaganda channels,
which effectively limits the audiences that Rus-
sia can reach with disinformation. “Humour and
satire work very well. When we make Russian
propagandists and their messages look stu-
pid and funny, people like it and share it. We
destroy the reputation of the Russian media
as a source of information,” said Ruslan Dey-
nychenko of StopFake. “We troll Russians, we
humiliate our enemy,” said Liubov Tsybulska.
“We diminish the influence of our enemies in
other countries by showing how laughable
they are.”
The same tool can be used not only against
the Kremlin leadership and their most visible
channels, but against smaller channels as well.
A CCD official described how many Ukrainians,
who are traditionally sceptical of government
messaging, put a great deal of trust in “insider”
channels that claimed to have inside informa-
tion on what was happening behind the scenes,
and shared it anonymously with the audience.

## LESSON 7: Humour is a serious matter



“The Russians built a network of these
insider channels; they were spreading a lot
of fakes and it wasn’t possible to debunk
everything. So the best way out of this
was when Ukrainian Telegram channels,
focusing on memes and jokes, started to
make fun of these channels, making ironic
jokes about insiders and the cases they
were highlighting,” the CCD official said.

Many Ukrainian interviewees also appreciated
the help that they were getting in this regard
from the international community, especially
from the already notorious NAFO “fellas”. As
in previous examples discussed in this report,
the number of actors involved in an activity and
the amount of material they produce is of great
importance.
The use of humour in Ukraine’s fight against
disinformation has received a lot of attention in
the post-FSI period, but it is worth pointing out
that Ukrainians were active in this regard even
before 2022. Ukraine’s official Twitter account
made headlines in the biggest American media
even during Petro Poroshenko’s administration,
when it used a Simpsons GIF to mock Russia’s
imperialist tendencies to appropriate Ukrainian

history.^41 One of the people who used to be
responsible for this communication channel,
Yarema Dukh, continues making fun of Russian
propaganda to this day.^42
The main difference between the pre-FSI and
post-FSI periods lies in the numbers. As already
mentioned, after February 2022, the number of
people involved in the fight for the information
space increased significantly - including among
those actors who actively use humour. Moreo-
ver, fiercer competition is yielding better results.
Yet despite all the positive effects of humour
in countering disinformation and propaganda,
concerns remain about some undesirable side
effects. “Most of these anti-propaganda chan-
nels that you can find on Ukrainian YouTube
don’t check the facts, they just mock Russian
propaganda. They say that Russians are stupid
and evil. But there’s a danger that they will
make you lose touch with reality. They can
lead you to underestimate the enemy and prop-
agate their wishful thinking. Of course it’s good
that they provide an antidote to the meddling,
but whether they really teach you critical
thinking, that’s a big question,” said Volodymyr
Yermolenko.^43


The Ukrainian experience has demonstrated
that disinformation and propaganda campaigns
are ineffective when the situation on the ground
is all too real. Since the beginning of the FSI,
Russian actors have insisted that their armed
forces only target military sites rather than
civilians.^44 This statement has been proven false
on multiple occasions.^45 When people saw or
experienced missile strikes, air raid alerts, and
atrocities, they quickly understood how Russian
claims carried no weight. “The best debunk was
a missile that each of us saw from our window,”
Ksenia Iliuk noted. After the FSI, any mention of
“brotherhood” in Russian propaganda was no
longer effective because it directly contradicted
the reality on the ground and Ukrainians’ lived
experiences. During wartime, the only way
for some lies to succeed is when the target
audience is already cut off from the information
space.

At the time of publication, most of the destruc-
tion and fighting is taking place in southeastern
Ukraine, where some people were more sym-
pathetic towards pro-Russian politicians before
the invasion.^46 Russia’s approach to inflicting
destruction in those regions quickly led to an
extreme decline in pro-Russian attitudes.^47
“The Russian atrocities changed the attitude
of potentially pro-Russian Ukrainians,” said
one source from the intelligence community.
According to Olga Tokariuk: “Everyone has a
friend or relative who is serving in the armed
forces, a source of information on the ground,
on the front lines. There was no shortage of
credible sources of information.”
The image of Russian “saviours” was shat-
tered after Russian forces retreated from
northern Ukraine and Ukrainian forces entered
the liberated cities and villages. The Russians
left behind torture chambers,^48 evidence of

## LESSON 8: Actions speak louder than words


extrajudicial killings,^49 and a trail of other human
rights abuses and war crimes. When journal-
ists reported from liberated settlements, they
uncovered what had occurred under Russian
occupation, duly deflating any remaining super-
ficial Ukrainian attitudes regarding Russian
troops. “When we saw what they had done and
showed it to the world, it was a huge blow to
the Russian information campaign. They made
the whole Ukrainian nation their enemy,” said
Taras Dzyuba.
Russia attacked civilian infrastructure in an
apparent attempt to pressure Ukrainians to pro-
test against the government and end further
resistance. These attempts backfired, however.
“The Russians would bombard or try to destroy
critical infrastructure, causing disruptions in
the electricity supply, and assuming that hitting
people would make [them] angrier [at their
own government]. But this was not the case;
they turned their anger against Russia and not
against the central government,” said Petro
Burkovskyi.
The actions of other countries also helped
debunk Russian disinformation. Russia pro-
moted a narrative that Ukraine had been aban-
doned by its allies, that no help was coming, or
that support would be limited to statements.
These messages collapsed when neighbouring
countries began hosting Ukrainian refugees,
imposed sanctions on Russia, and delivered mil-
itary and humanitarian aid. “One of the objec-
tives of the Russian disinformation campaigns
was to undermine the trust of Ukrainians in

Post_ , 2022. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/07/russia-killing-civilians-kyiv-ukraine-un/.


foreign aid, in partners,” Gosha Tykhyi explained.
“So we communicated extensively on how the
international coalition in support of Ukraine was
being built, how more countries were joining,
how more support was coming, how they were
making statements, and how they were applying
sanctions.”
Those who became refugees or internally dis-
placed persons also acted as sources of infor-
mation on external support for Ukraine. Their
experience and communication with relatives
who remained in Ukraine helped to paint a pos-
itive picture of other countries providing them
with support, which differed from the claims
made via Russian disinformation channels. In
addition, visits by foreign officials to Ukraine
in the midst of the war demonstrated interna-
tional support for the Ukrainian people, further
countering narratives suggesting that Ukraine
no longer had any allies.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the
Russians were somewhat successful in spread-
ing disinformation in regions where they man-
aged to cut the population off from objective
sources of information. Russia targeted resi-
dents of occupied territories with stories about
Ukraine’s alleged retaliation. According to Maria
Avdeeva, such claims were more likely to res-
onate because “This was the only information
people got, so they didn’t know what was hap-
pening. They might not have known what was
happening in Bucha; they didn’t see such atroci-
ties because of the lack of information.”


In the months following the 2022 invasion,
many outlets and experts rushed to claim that
Ukraine was winning^50 or had already won^51 the
information war, simply because it was more
effective at social media and had employed
communication tools to outclass Russia. While
the majority of our interviewees agreed that
Ukraine was far more effective in the first year
of the war than Russia, none of them believed
that the information confrontation was over;
rather, they emphasized the importance of
alertness and the work that remained to be
done. Several even highlighted that there is no
such thing as an “end” or a “victory” when it
comes to information warfare. An information
confrontation does not have clear boundaries
and often extends beyond armed conflict.
“The information war won’t end with
the kinetic one – it’s impossible to win an
information war,” an SSU official noted.
CCD interviewees highlighted a similar idea:
“It [information war] is a never-ending process,
and there’s no moment when you can just say
‘We won’,” one of them explained. The process
exploits new events from an endless news
cycle, applying tried and tested propaganda
techniques to manipulate facts in narrative
weapons. “The Russians take a kernel of truth
and wrap it up in fancy wrapping paper,” Texty
editor-in-chief Roman Kulchynsky stated. The
Kremlin’s information operations also continue
to evolve. “We’re finding countermeasures, but
the Russians are looking for new tools,” said an

SSU official. The potential range of tools, topics,
and platforms is constantly growing, making the
cycle indefinite while deepening it.
Even the idea of measuring success in
information warfare is highly problematic. For
instance, from the perspective of an observer
outside Ukraine, it might seem that Russian
narratives have not had any effect on Ukrainian
public opinion. But many topics used by the
Russians are in line with popular grievances.
“Some operations are pretty successful, espe-
cially those that are designed to divide us, when
they use our internal vulnerabilities, and when
we don’t understand who is behind the threat
or campaign,” said Liubov Tsybulska. Such cam-
paigns blur the line between significant domes-
tic problems and smaller ones successfully
amplified by Russian propaganda. This makes
measurement even more problematic.
Researchers cannot be certain about what
Russia considers success without knowing its
informational objectives, which can be gleaned
from narrative patterns but otherwise only truly
known by their authors in Moscow. Furthermore,
the idea of effectiveness in an information
war is quite murky. Some campaigns and mes-
sages might be evaluated against engagement
metrics, such as views, shares, reactions, and
comments, making the most “viral” publications
stand out at first glance. But these figures do
not necessarily directly reflect actual influence ,
rendering the measurement of information
warfare’s impact on people’s behaviour uncer-

tain. “Russia’s criterion is the scope and reach
regarding how many people read the news,” said
Ihor Solovey. “But it’s impossible to measure
whether a news item reached the reader and
influenced them.”
Interviewees did point to some indicators
of success, however, such as when Russian dis-
information operations are amplified by other
actors, both within Ukraine or abroad, or when
Russian threats are used as an excuse not to
provide Ukraine with the necessary support, in
order to avoid provoking Russia.
Some Russian messaging efforts have been
successfully propagated via the international
media,^52 and this factor alone could count as a
success for some of the campaigns. “In main-
stream media, some analysts or even journalists
questioned Russia’s responsibility for this war
crime,” Olga Tokariuk said when discussing Rus-
sian atrocities in the town of Bucha. “They said,
‘But are we sure that the Bucha massacre wasn’t
staged by the Ukrainians?’” The mere presence
of “bothsidesism” in media coverage fails to
distinguish between true and false versions of
an event, ultimately sowing confusion and dam-
aging Ukraine’s credibility among its audiences.
The answers to the questions about Russia’s
success are inconclusive. On the one hand, many
interviewees claimed that Russia is ineffective
because the West is still sending aid to Ukraine.
On the other hand, when discussing Western
support in further detail, many interviewees -
including some who had expressed scepticism

regarding the impact of the Russian operations -
admitted that Russia had achieved some tactical
successes. “I think Russia’s biggest success was
not stopping the aid, but postponing it,” said
Molfar’s Artem Starosiek.
An additional layer is agenda-setting -
attempts to influence topics being discussed in
different societies. While any message in isola-
tion has a low probability of changing opinion,
ongoing chatter about specific issues might lead
some people to change their way of thinking.


“Russia is capitalizing on all the old myths
that it must not be provoked. And of
course, if Russia keeps the United States
thinking that it could escalate and this
prevents the United States from giving
Ukraine what it needs to win, then yes,
Russia is succeeding in this direction. But,
of course, this information influence is
notoriously difficult to quantify,” said Alya
Shandra of Euromaidan Press.


Finally, Russia has a long history of influence
campaigns and active measures^53 through peri-
ods of hot and cold conflicts. The trajectory of
this influence often moves towards the inten-
sification of active measures. Not all are suc-
cessful, but some may yield significant results,
such as Operation Infektion, in which the USSR
used proxies to promulgate the conspiracy the-
ory that the US government had intentionally
developed HIV/AIDS as a bioweapon.^54 While


some might argue that the Russians lost the
first phase of the current war, “It does not mean
they have stopped,” noted Ihor Solovey. “They
will continue working and try to get better.” An
SSU official echoed a similar sentiment: “Despite
the lack of Russian success, they cannot be
underestimated because they are smart and
skilful in this field and they have been creating
a network for the covert promotion of Russian
disinformation in the world for years.” StopFake’s
Ruslan Deynychenko agreed. “Russians are con-
stantly learning from experience. They are flexi-
ble. They started with one set of messages, and
when they realized that these messages were no
longer working, they changed them completely,”
he said.


The last lesson learned is different from the previous ones in the sense that it will describe what Ukrainians learned they _cannot_ do, or at least not on their own - and where they need some help from the democratic world. Their first recommendation would be that the West should do what Ukraine has been doing for the past few years.
Several interviewees expressed concern that Western countries are not doing enough to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda channels, or the witting or unwitting agents who are helping them to spread in their own countries, which could ultimately result in diminished support for Ukraine. “It would be really helpful if our partners started working [against] Russian propaganda actors in their own countries. It’s not that we need people here. We need them to work with this threat domestically. We have more or less managed to do this in Ukraine,” said Liubov Tsybulska. Gosha Tykhyi added: “We need our partners to step up efforts to counter Russian disinformation.” The most elaborate idea was put forward by the Centre for Strategic Communications.^55 “We would very much like to see an international coalition supporting Ukraine in the information space,” said Ihor Solovey. “Based on the analogy with the military Ramstein group [the alliance of nations supplying Ukraine with military aid], we talk about [creating an] Information Ramstein.” “Information Ramstein” would bring together two primary groups. One group would include civil society, journalists, the private sector - all the non-governmental parts of the information ecosystem. The other would include governments and their institutions, such as ministries or secret services. “Governments can’t order civil society to do anything in Germany or France. But they can and should shut down Russian channels,” Solovey said, and continued:   “Russians are openly saying they are fighting against the West. And all the TV channels, agencies, social media accounts, politicians and everything else – all this is part of the hybrid war against the West. If you don’t fight against it, you could suffer the same fate as Ukraine; you will be next.”   In early 2023, the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture reached out to Brussels with regard to this project.^56 Some interviewees would like to see similar measures applied to other actors beyond Russia. “Foreign governments should work with the media and with social media platforms to force them to address the issue,” said Texty’s Ruslan Deynychenko. “We need efforts to de-platform those players, not only Russians, but all those who use or try to use disinformation as a weapon.” Others would like to see measures that go beyond de-platforming Russian channels.
“Investigating Russian influence agents and also various Russian soft power organizations in the West is still a very broad field of work,” said Olga Tokariuk. The investigation of various information campaigns, especially those in which different Western actors spread the same kind of messaging, was also raised during the interview with the SSU: “(...) to expose that these are coordinated actions and Russia is behind them,” one SSU official commented, and continued:   “It’s worth flagging channels that systematically broadcast Russian disinformation (similar to the verification icon on social networks). Then internet users will understand that they are reading material from a hidden Russian information agent.
Investigative journalists could analyze their sources of funding and relationships in the dissemination of narratives.”  “We need a special criminal tribunal, and the list must include at least the top Russian propagandists,” added Detector Media’s Galyna Petrenko.
Among other measures she mentioned was demonetization. “The big tech companies and major advertisers should not allow propagandist platforms and propagandist media to make money from advertising,” she said. Petrenko also mentioned that Ukraine would need help from Western tech companies with the aforementioned problem: how to deliver dependable information to the people in the temporarily occupied territories.
 While Europe has expanded some of its Russian channel restrictions in the post-FSI period, Ukrainian practitioners believed these actions were not enough.
“We analyzed 40 countries, and about 20% of all publications on Ukraine still use Russian state media or Russian-affiliated media as a source of information on Ukraine. That’s huge. And we see that Russia is even expanding on that,” said Ksenia Iliuk from LetsData.^57   Some opinion polls in Europe have shown that the Kremlin’s disinformation efforts continue to convince up to one-third of the population in various European countries.^58 As the interviewees highlighted in Lesson 9, Kremlin propaganda was probably successful in deterring some countries from supporting Ukraine, or at least in persuading them to postpone some decisions that would have been vital in mitigating Russian aggression.^59   “The Russians have been selling fear for years. They were able to scare NATO into not admitting Ukraine and Georgia in 2008. They were able to scare many people into many things. And one of the things we are teaching the West right now is to stop fearing Russia,” Gosha Tykhyi concluded.
  This report discussed lessons learned by Ukrainian practitioners in Ukraine’s fight against Russian disinformation, which EU and NATO countries could gain insights from and draw upon.
The described measures are only a part of the Ukrainian resistance against Russian aggression.
As discussed in Lesson 8, actions in the physical world are of paramount importance, but the information environment can also shape what happens in the kinetic domain, making the battle for the information space an important part of the resistance.
To sum up the first lessons learned by Ukrainian practitioners for this report: It is crucial to dedicate sufficient energy to basic tasks such as monitoring, refuting, and debunking lies, and to ensure that these tasks are performed properly and without any gaps. Likewise, considerable resources are required in the information arena along with a large number of different actors and activities. To this end, governments cannot rely solely on their own resources. They need to involve civil society and the private sector, and actively cooperate with them.
  Developing such a system, and the network of connections that undergirds it, will demand time and the sustained efforts of numerous people. Ukrainians have been building a system for a decade, ever since the Euromaidan protests and the annexation of Crimea. A vibrant civil society took the lead to begin with, with the government subsequently becoming more active. The numerous counter-disinformation projects and initiatives that were activated between 2014 and 2022 were crucial for the period after February 2022. According to the Ukrainian practitioners interviewed for this report, the primary takeaway for any other country would be to start dedicating significant resources to this fight sooner rather than later, because building a nation’s information resilience calls for the dedication and vigilance of many people and organizations over many years.
In all likelihood, Russian disinformation, propaganda, and information aggression will continue, even after the kinetic warfare comes to an end. The investments made in resisting malign influence will pay off for many years to come.
